    "### 1.1 Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I plan to build an intelligent recommendation engine for beauty products that are sold on Amazon.com. By providing recommendations, Amazon.com will give its customers the ability to take their brand experiences into their hands and make informed decisions. This level of personalization will support higher customer retention and reinforce brand loyalty."

    "### 1.2 Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Wrangling:\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the json files into pandas dataframe, the raw data will be cleaned, structured and enriched into a cleaner format. Clean data will allow quicker and better analysis, producing more accurate results. The identification and removal of error and duplicity in datasets will create a reliable dataset, enabling an outcome of better quality. This step was completed in the first milestone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EDA:\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is the initial basic exploration of the dataset in a systematic manner using visual methods. This step will include identification and elimination of outliers as well as checking for correlations between the independent variables. This step was also completed in the first milestone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Different types of recommender systems will be built using Machine learning algorithms. \n",
    "The algorithms can be classified into two categories: Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering. Modern recommenders use a hybrid approach which is a combination of these two.\n",
    "Recommender systems are applied where many users interact with many items. We have a rich dataset with item attributes and historical user reviews for these items, that will be used to train and test the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of offline and online evaluation metrics are available to measure the accuracy of recommender systems. Each model will be evaluated using these metrics and the scores will be compared to determine the best performance. Strong recommender systems can have positive effects on user experience. They can result into higher customer satisfaction and retention, and in turn boost revenues."

Some of these new columns were not related to Beauty and Personal care so they were dropped. Only the new columns \"Beauty\" and \"Health & Personal Care\" were retained.\n",

The \"related\" column was then split into 4 new columns \"also_bought\", \"also_viewed\", \"bought_together\" and \"buy_after_viewing\". Then the values in these 4 columns were concatenated into a large string. Using iterrows, each asin in the dataframe was checked against the string and the number of occurrences of this asin in the string was captured in the \"related_count\" column.

    "\n",
    "This is the simplest recommendation system. As is obvious from the name, it simply recommends the popular and highly rated items to all the users. The bigest drawback of this system is that it is non-personalized and recommends the same items to everyone. Since users' have different tastes and preferences, this is not a very useful filtering method.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of measuring popularity is by counting the number of times an item was rated. Higher the rating count, more popular the item is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the item with highest average ratings are also popular and can be recommended to all customers. We also calculated polarity of customer ratings using the review text. Items with higher mean polarity would be some great recommendations to customers as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to measure the popularity of an item is by checking it's related_count. This count was extracted by adding the number of times an item was clicked or viewed or bought after viewing or together with another item. The higher the related_count, the more popular the item should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have sales ranking for the items either under beauty or under health_personal_care categories. Another way of determining popular items is by looking for their sales rank under either of these columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular items can also be determine using weighted average ratings. \n",

    "It is the simplest form of recommendation system.\n",

    "### 4.2 Content-based Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "This method recommends an item based on its features and how similar they are to features of other items in the data set. It is based on similarity of item attributes, which can be determined using cosine similarity or nearest neighbor algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The past interactions of a given user with items is taken into account, ignoring all other users. Items are recommended based on comparison between contents of the items and a user profile. The content of each item could be represented as descriptor or terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will combine the brand_title, main_cat and description features of the items into a single feature and convert it into vector form so it can be effectively used for determining similarities between different items.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a fair analysis, we will include only those items from the dataset that have been reviewed more than 10 times and less then 7000 times. Less than 10 ratings means not many users have reviewed the item. More than 7000 ratings means the item is already quite popular and would show up as a recommendation, regardless.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will use 33,878 items filtering using their content/attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The item attributes are converted to vector form using TFIDF and Count vectorizers. \n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is heavily used in Natural Language Processing and is used in information retrieval using feature extraction processes. It is a measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in document corpus. The text columns are combined into one and their text will be used to fit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other approach is to use the CountVectorizer, which counts the number of times a token shows up in the document and uses this value as its weight. It is simpler than TfidfVectorizer. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pairwise similarity is computed using:\n",
    "1. Cosine Similarity \n",
    "2. Linear Kernel \n",
    "3. Euclidean distance\n",
    "4. Pearson Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pros and Cons of Content-based Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pros:\n",
    "The recommendations are specific to one user, therefore the model does not need any data about other users. This makes it easier to scale to a large number of users. It is very effective in recommending niche items, since it can capture the specific interests of a user. With sufficient description, the cold start problem can be eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cons:\n",
    "The feature representation of the items must be very rich because the model solely depends on that. The model can make recommendations based only on existing interests of the user. So it tends to over-specialize and will recommend items only similar to those already used and rated.\n",

    "### 4.3 Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering method ignores User and Item attributes and instead focuses on User-Item Interactions. Recommendations are purely based on past behavior and not on the context. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is based on the similarity in preferences of two users. It determines similarities between 2 users or 2 items, using the historical ratings given to items by various users and makes recommendations on the basis of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept here is to develop algorithms that operate independently of the characteristics of particular items being recommended. Patterns between users and items are identified and used to make recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the customer rating for items, a utility matrix is built. These ratings can be explicit (rating on a scale of 1 to 5, likes or dislikes) or implicit (viewing an item, adding it to a wish list, the time spent on an article). In the matrix, each row contains the ratings given by a user and each column contains the ratings received by an item. The matrix is typically sparse as not every user uses every item nor do they rate every item they use.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of collaborative filtering methods:\n",
    "1. Memory-based: Statistical techniques are applied to the entire dataset to calculate the predictions.\n",
    "2. Model-based: Involve a step to reduce or compress the large but sparse user-item matrix. Matrix factorization can be performed using the singular value decomposition (SVD) algorithm or principal component analysis (PCA).\n",

    "\n",
    "Recommendations are given to a user on the basis of the likes and dislikes of similar users. This method is useful when the number of users is less. Its not effective when there are a large number of users as it will take a lot of time to compute the similarity between all user pairs.\n",

    "#### 4.3.2 Item-Item collaborative filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "Item-based recommenders are faster than user-based for large datasets. They make the recommendations by computing the similarity between each pair of items.\n",

    "#### Pros and Cons of Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pros:\n",
    "This filtering method does not require any knowledge about features of users and items. Also, it can help recommenders to not overspecialize in a user’s profile and recommend items that are completely different from what they have seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cons:\n",
    "There can be cold-start problem for new items that are added to the list. Until someone rates them, they don’t get recommended. Also complexity increases as the size of datasets increase. \n",
