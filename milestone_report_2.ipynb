    "### 1.1 Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I plan to build an intelligent recommendation engine for beauty products that are sold on Amazon.com. By providing recommendations, Amazon.com will give its customers the ability to take their brand experiences into their hands and make informed decisions. This level of personalization will support higher customer retention and reinforce brand loyalty."

    "### 1.2 Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Wrangling:\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the json files into pandas dataframe, the raw data will be cleaned, structured and enriched into a cleaner format. Clean data will allow quicker and better analysis, producing more accurate results. The identification and removal of error and duplicity in datasets will create a reliable dataset, enabling an outcome of better quality. This step was completed in the first milestone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### EDA:\n",
    "\n",
    "EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is the initial basic exploration of the dataset in a systematic manner using visual methods. This step will include identification and elimination of outliers as well as checking for correlations between the independent variables. This step was also completed in the first milestone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Machine Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Different types of recommender systems will be built using Machine learning algorithms. \n",
    "The algorithms can be classified into two categories: Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering. Modern recommenders use a hybrid approach which is a combination of these two.\n",
    "Recommender systems are applied where many users interact with many items. We have a rich dataset with item attributes and historical user reviews for these items, that will be used to train and test the models. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of offline and online evaluation metrics are available to measure the accuracy of recommender systems. Each model will be evaluated using these metrics and the scores will be compared to determine the best performance. Strong recommender systems can have positive effects on user experience. They can result into higher customer satisfaction and retention, and in turn boost revenues."

Some of these new columns were not related to Beauty and Personal care so they were dropped. Only the new columns \"Beauty\" and \"Health & Personal Care\" were retained.\n",

The \"related\" column was then split into 4 new columns \"also_bought\", \"also_viewed\", \"bought_together\" and \"buy_after_viewing\". Then the values in these 4 columns were concatenated into a large string. Using iterrows, each asin in the dataframe was checked against the string and the number of occurrences of this asin in the string was captured in the \"related_count\" column.

    "##### Pros:\n",
    "The recommendations are specific to one user, therefore the model does not need any data about other users. This makes it easier to scale to a large number of users. It is very effective in recommending niche items, since it can capture the specific interests of a user. With sufficient description, the cold start problem can be eliminated.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cons:\n",
    "The feature representation of the items must be very rich because the model solely depends on that. The model can make recommendations based only on existing interests of the user. So it tends to over-specialize and will recommend items only similar to those already used and rated."
